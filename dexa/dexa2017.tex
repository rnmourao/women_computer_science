This study examined Brazilian high school girls' intention to apply for Computer Science (CS) undergraduate courses, the influence of the family and students' perceptions of CS Course and career as well as students’ attendance at CS courses at school, computer use in the home and other places. The participants were 1709 female students who completed an anonymous questionnaire. Results from Association Rules in Data Mining indicated that girls who have family's approval to applying for a CS course and believe that this area of knowledge explores creativity, have a higher chance to apply for a CS Program. Knowledge gained through this study will eventually guide future research and interventions designed to enhance girls' motivation to pursue CS careers.
