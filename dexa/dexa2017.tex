The field of Computer Science (CS) has been of little interest for girls straight out of high school, when considering undergraduate majors in Brazil. At the University of Brasília’s CS Department, female students compose less than 10\% of the student body. In an effort to understand the girls’ lack of interest in computer related courses, we applied an anonymous questionnaire, from 2011 to 2014, regarding their perceptions of the field. We applied Association Rules in Data Mining to analyze the 1709 responses of these questionnaires. Knowledge gained through this study could guide future research on the matter and guidelines for motivating girls to pursue careers in Computer Science.
