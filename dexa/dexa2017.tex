In the last years, many reflections arose about the low rates of female admissions in Computer Science undergraduate programs. Between the years of 2012 and 2014, girls at Middle and High School at Distrito Federal (N = 1707) answered a questionnaire related to their perceptions about Computer Science and their degree of contact with computers, in order to find a relationship between these perceptions and habits, and the intention to applying for a Computer Science undergraduate course. Results from two-way ANOVA indicated that girls who have family approval to applying for a Computer Science course and use LAN Houses have a higher probability to apply for a Computer Science's program.
