\section{Data Mining}\label{sec:mining}%
%3. Teoria sobre a análise dos Dados (Roberto e Guilherme).%

Data mining can be defined as the process of discovering insightful patterns and predictive models from data~\cite{Zaki2014}, trying to make sense of usually large amounts of data in some domain~\cite{Cios2007}. \gnramos{In this work, the main interest is the gender gap in the fields of the ``hard sciences'', so we attempt to understand the profiles of women intending to enroll in undergraduate studies, specially those interested in Computer Science.}

From 2012 to 2014, 1709 people were polled, responding a questionnaire\footnote{\url{https://github.com/rnmourao/women\_computer\_science/blob/master/data/questionnaire.pdf}}. The idea was to obtain information on their perceptions of their future undergraduate studies.

		\end{itemize}
	\item Does working with Computer Science brings prestige?
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Yes

\subsection{Statistical Analysis}\label{sec:mining:stat}%
The usual pre-processing tasks were quickly done; all questionnaires were created and processed by CESPE\footnote{\url{http://www.cespe.unb.br/}}, a specialized research center, and the results given in simple spreadsheets. The data for all years was consolidated in a single spreadsheet\footnote{\url{https://github.com/rnmourao/women\_computer\_science/blob/master/data/raw.xlsx}}
which was then processed in the \texttt{R} programming language.

The script cleans up the data (empty columns, whitespaces, etc.) and begins to process it for analysis. The first step is to consider only the data for the 1709 female respondents. The data is distributed throughout the years as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:RespondentsPerYear}. \gnramos{Descrição desta informação}.

Figure~\ref{fig:EducationalStage} shows how the respondents were distributed by educational stage, indicates that \gnramos{qual a relevância desta informação?},

\end{figure}%

Figure~\ref{fig:FieldOfInterest} shows the respondents' interest in applying for a Computer Science course. This results indicate that $31\%$  \emph{have interest}, $28\%$  \emph{have no interest}, and $41\%$  \emph{have doubt}.

\end{figure}%

Figure~\ref{fig:InterestInCS.pdf} shows the respondents' interest in different fields of study. This results indicate that, throughout the years, the percentages for each choice remains more or less the same with an average of $41\%$ for \emph{Biology-Health Sciences}, $22\%$ for \emph{Exact Sciences} and $33\%$ for \emph{Human Sciences}.

% ANOVA %%%%%%%%%%%
As described earlier, the data consisted of a group of 1,709 questionnaires with 18 questions each. There were 3,707 questionnaires, but some were excluded for many reasons: some were answered by men, others were answered by College or Adult Education Program students. None of these were adequate for the study. The questionnaires from 2011 were excluded because the poll was conducted differently of the others years.

The \emph{CS.Interest} attribute, related to the intention of the respondent for applying to a Computer Science Undergraduate Course, was used to create a numeric variable, named as \emph{CS.Choice}. When there was `No' in CS.Interest, CS.Choice was filled with the value -1; when `Maybe', CS.Choice got 0, and when CS.Interest was `Yes', CS.Choice received the value 1. In this study, the attribute \emph{CS.Choice} was used as response variable~\cite{moore2009practice}. The others 35 attributes were used as explanatory variables, turning in a treatment each possible answer for each variable.

The grand mean, i.e., the general mean for the attribute CS.Choice was 0.03.

The next step was to perform a One-Way ANOVA with the treatments of all attributes, removing one by one, based on the treatments' significance~\cite{Chambers1990}. Since the data was naturally unbalanced, the ANOVA used the `Type III' Sum of Squares. 

A series of One-Way ANOVAs was performed to compare the effect of each remaining attribute on the students' intention to applying for a Computer Science Course. A Tukey HSD test was used for the cases when there was more than two treatments.
 
Then, it was executed a Two-Way ANOVA to evaluate the interactions between the attributes' treatments.

After analyze each treatment, there was selected the treatment with significance, and higher mean for the CS.Choice attribute.
