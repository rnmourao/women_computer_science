Between the years of 2012 and 2014, we contacted thousands of girls in Middle and High School to investigate the relationship between their intention to apply for an undergraduate course in Computer Science and their affinity with the field and computing tools. We applied the Apriori algorithm on the collected data, searching for interesting association rules and insights on the girls' interest in CS and their background.

This following sections of this work are organized as follows: Section~\ref{sec:background} presents related work and background information on this approach, Section~\ref{sec:mining} describes details of the data mining applied, Section~\ref{sec:results} provides our experimental results and our finds and Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} presents concluding remarks.
