\subsection{Data Analysis}\label{subsec:background:data}%

Data analysis includes, among other things, procedures for analyzing data and techniques for interpreting their results~\cite{Tukey1962}.

ANOVA ~\cite{Hastie2009}


Frequently, data may be usefully and accurately treated by the analysis of variance (through separation of the variance attributes to a group of causes from that attributed to other groups)~\cite{Fisher1934}. This \emph{analysis of variance} (ANOVA)can be achieved through several approaches, for example through a hypothesis test comparing the two models, considering the null hypothesis that both models fit the data equally well in contrast to  the full model is superior~\cite{James2013}.
