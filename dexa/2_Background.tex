Papastergiou~\cite{papastergiou_are_2008} investigated 358 male and female greek high school students' intentions and motivation towards and against pursuing academic studies in Computer Science (CS). The research pertained the influence of the family and the scholastic environment on students' career choices, the students' perceptions of CS profession as well as students' attendance at CS courses at school, the computer use in the home and the self-efficacy beliefs regarding computers. The study revealed that lack of opportunities for early use of computer in home and school seems to be the main factor of discouragement to boys and girls decide to study CS, having a much greater impact on girls; employability seems to be the main reason why Greek students decide to study CS; girls' motivation towards studying CS is related to extrinsic factors, e.g., enhanced employment prospects, rather than intrinsic ones, e.g., personal interest in CS; the majority of the students were not found to be explicitly encouraged to or deterred from studying CS by their family, friends, CS teachers or other adults; the students of the sample do not consider CS and the IT profession as masculine fields; within the home environment, girls were found to be less likely than boys to use a computer.

Anderson et al.~\cite{anderson_because_2008}, during three years, studied possible factors related to  low participation rates by females in education pathways leading to professional level information and communications technology (ICT) professions. The survey was offered to 1,453 senior high school girls, and used binary options, e.g., "I am very interested in computers" and "I am not interested in computers". The study identified that are two factors associated with women's aversion toward a ICT profession: the perception that these subjects are boring, and a strongly aversion to computers.
